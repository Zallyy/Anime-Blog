                        &Tab;<strong>Hello I'm Zally</strong>, I made this
                        website mainly as practice, but also as an outlet for
                        all my anime-related thoughts. I've been watching anime
                        since I was 12 years old, and it's left a big impact on
                        my life. I used to think talking about it and expressing
                        myself was a little cringe, but even if it is, it's so
                        darn fun. Anime is my main, but not only inspiration, to
                        me, nothing feels better than watching an episode of
                        your favorite show while you're down. I hope you enjoy
                        just looking around, this isn't meant to be super
                        serious, but if you find some meaning in it, that's cool
                        too.
