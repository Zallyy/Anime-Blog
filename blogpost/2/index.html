                        This opening, and in turn, this entire show makes me so happy. Watching Handa learn to let loose
                        and have fun was an eye opener to me, since I myself can get caught up in the seriousness of it
                        all. We all need a reminder to enjoy the little things around us.

                        This song + show combo never fail to relax me and put me at ease. Despite how cheesy the show
                        can be at times, it makes me want to be the best person I can be.

                        I really want to rewatch this show, when I first watched it, I didn't really care too much about
                        it to be honest, I feel like I'll have a new appreciation now that I'm older. Anyways, this
                        opening is a banger.

                        This is the anime that really got me more interested in the cyber-punk genre. It was also my
                        first physical purchase of an anime series. I hold it near and dear, and I still do in the
