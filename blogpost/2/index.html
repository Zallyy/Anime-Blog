                        This opening, and in turn, this entire show makes me so happy. Watching Handa learn to let loose
                        and have fun was an eye opener to me, since I myself can get caught up in the seriousness of it
                        all. We all need a reminder to enjoy the little things around us.

                        I absolutely love this opening, the visuals, the song, the atmosphere. If I had to make a list
                        of the best openings in terms of sheer quality, this one would be up there.

                        This song + show combo never fail to relax me and put me at ease. Despite how cheesy the show
                        can be at times, it makes me want to be the best person I can be.

                        I really want to rewatch this show, when I first watched it, I didn't really care too much about

                        opening is a banger.

                        This is the anime that really got me more interested in the cyber-punk genre. It was also my

                        This was one of my first anime, and although i'm sure I would think it's pretty basic now. I
                        still think the openings in this show were killer. This show has mainly stuck with me for these
                        reasons, also I just really like Shana's voice actor.
