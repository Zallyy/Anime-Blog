                        As of writing this I have watched 10/24 episodes of Gou. So far it's pretty mediocre, not much
                        has changed from the original, don't get me wrong theres plenty of subtle changes, and I'm sure
                        it's going to get more interesting for long time viewers when the answer arcs start coming
                        however, as of now Gou is pandering to both new and old comers alike, and for someone who has
                        already seen the original, Gou's repetetive exposition kind of gets annoying.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog__paragraph">
                        Gou should have been a pure sequel, OR at the very least be entirely new arcs. I know that
                        wouldn't make too much sense in hindsight, but I believe it's possible. These arcs are like 80%
                        rewatching the original, and to old timers it's just really annoying. I do appreciate the visual
                        upgrades, and I'm still enjoying the show, but I cant stop thinking about how much better this
                        would be without these qualities.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog__paragraph">
                        Besides that, I do have hope that the answer arcs will WOW long time viewers enough for us to
                        forgive them. I get it, you want to appeal to a mass audience without having them need to check
                        out the source or original 2007 anime.

                        Finally, let's talk about Rika. One thing I didn't like about the original anime is that they
                        never explained how much she remembers clearly, I've only been more well informed by talking
                        with the VN readers, so lately in these arcs, Rika's decision making seems to be pretty stupid.
                        She knows if she acts in this childish way and trys to subtley manipulate everyone from the
                        shadows that she wont win. She hasn't even tried to trust her friends, and that's starting to
                        annoy me. I wonder if they'll comment on this in the answer arcs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog__paragraph">
                        All in all, I'm enjoying the remake/sequel enough right now. It's by no means great, but as a
                        stand-alone, it's a better production than the original. People have been hating on it since
                        they cut out a lot of the paranoia aspects, I loved those aspects too. But, ultimately, thats
                        not what higurashi is about and that's not logical being that in Gou, the characters seemed to
                        have learned subconciously through their previous experiece. What do you guys think?
